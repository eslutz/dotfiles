# =============================================================================
# Test Fixtures
# =============================================================================
# This directory contains test data, mock files, and sample configurations
# used by the test suite

## Directory Structure

- `config/` - Sample configuration files for testing
- `dotfiles/` - Sample dotfiles for testing link operations
- `scripts/` - Mock scripts and helper utilities for testing
- `data/` - Test data files (JSON, text, etc.)

## Usage

Test fixtures are designed to provide consistent, controlled data for tests
without relying on external systems or the user's actual configuration.

## Guidelines

- Keep fixtures minimal and focused on specific test scenarios
- Use descriptive names that indicate the test purpose
- Clean up any temporary files created during testing
- Document any special requirements or setup for fixtures
